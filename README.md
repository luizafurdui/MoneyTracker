# Money Tracker - Track Your Expenses and Income
Money Tracker is a simple financial tracking application that allows you to add, view, and manage your transactions. It is built using:

React
Express
MongoDB
Tailwind CSS

âœ¨**Features**

Add transactions for income and expenses.
Automatically calculates and displays your balance.
View all transactions with details such as date, description, and amount.
Fully responsive design for both mobile and desktop views.
Data is stored in MongoDB for persistence.

ðŸ“’** Process**

I started by setting up the backend with Express and connected it to MongoDB for data storage. Next, I focused on building the frontend using React to allow users to input transactions and view them dynamically. I used Tailwind CSS to style the UI and make it responsive.

Afterwards, I added the functionality to display a running balance based on the added transactions. Finally, I refined the user interface to make it intuitive and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.

During development, I incorporated some small improvements, such as error handling and form validation. The app communicates with the backend to store and retrieve transactions from the database, ensuring data persistence.

NOTE: The project's purpose is to demonstrate full-stack development using the MERN stack. It is designed as a learning tool and is not intended to be a fully-featured financial app.
